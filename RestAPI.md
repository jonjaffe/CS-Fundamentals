There are three ways to add an API to an existing project:

##### Bolt-On Strategy
- You have an existing application and add an API after the fact.

This is often considered a brute force approach, but is the fastest way to get value from the API, since the underlying system is functional the whole time.

This takes advantage of existing code and systems. Unfortunately, poor architectural decisions and bad naming tends to seep through the system and cause problems in the external interfaces, with helper libraries, and all the supporting client code in pieces.
